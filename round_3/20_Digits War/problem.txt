Digits War

There has been a war between the digits in the kingdom of numbers and it is King Infinity's job to restore balance. In search of peace he came up with a new number system which only allows those numbers to exist in which:

1. None of the consecutive digits are at war against each other.

2. No two digits that have only one digit in between them are at war.

For example, if 4 is at war with 5, then 45, 405, and 574 are all forbidden.

A digit can be at war with itself. You are given a 10 x 10 binary matrix M (0 index based), where M[i][j] denotes whether there is a war between digit i and digit j. If M[i][j] = 1 then they are at war and M[i][j] = 0 means they are not. M[i][j] will always be equal to M[j][i].

Your task is to find the count of positive numbers that can exist in this number system with number of digits ≤ K. No number in the number system can have leading zeroes.

Limits
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^18
Input
Input consists of T test cases, with T ≤ 25. Each test case begins with the value of K followed by a 10x10 binary matrix.
Output
For every test case output the result modulo 10^9 +7
